        <h1>Krithika Swaminathan</h1>
        <p>A passionate and curious learner, I enjoy using my skills to solve real-world problems. I believe that my
            experience in software development, coupled with a strong foundation in machine learning and natural
            language processing, has equipped me with the skills to create innovative and impactful solutions. </p>

        <p>Lately, I've also been developing a growing passion for cybersecurity and exploring it at the entry level,
            strengthening my understanding of how to build solutions that are not only effective but also secure and
            resilient.</p>

        <p>Beyond my technical skills, I'm a driven individual with a keen interest in community engagement and enabling
            accessible education for all. Every small step towards change counts and I'm dedicated to using my knowledge
            to help make a difference in the lives of others.</p>

        <p>Right now, I am thrilled to be working at Citi as a Technology Analyst, learning from experienced
            professionals and contributing to interesting projects. I look forward to continuing to grow as a software
            developer and creating secure, scalable and meaningful technological solutions that can shape a better
            future.</p>
